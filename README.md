# GLP Menu For Today

![alt tag](./screenshot.png)

This is my personal website project from high school. 

Using Google image API, I made a website that automatically uploads school lunch menu in images for English speaking faculty who cannot read the school's Korean menu. My algorithm puts Korean menu texts in an array, and the searching method from Google API displays the first image that shows up on Google image search for every element of the array.
